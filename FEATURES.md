# New Features Guide

This document provides detailed information about the recently added features to the Coinfliponchain application.

## üé® Enhanced Coin-Flip Animation

### Overview
We've significantly upgraded the coin flip animation to provide a more immersive and engaging user experience. Users can now choose between two animation modes.

### Animation Modes

#### Standard Animation
- Classic 2D coin rotation
- Smooth rotateY(1800deg) transformation
- Fast and lightweight
- Works perfectly on all devices
- Duration: 0.6 seconds

#### Enhanced 3D Animation (New!)
- Full 3D perspective with multi-axis rotation
- Dynamic scaling during flip (scales up to 1.2x)
- X-axis tilt (¬±15deg) for realistic physics
- Particle burst effects radiating from coin
- Duration: 1.0 seconds for more drama

### Visual Effects

#### Particle Burst
- 8 particles emitted in radial pattern
- Golden color matching coin aesthetic
- Animates outward during flip
- Fades out smoothly
- CSS-based for performance

#### Glow Pulse (Win Celebration)
- Pulsing golden glow effect
- Activates on winning bets
- Smooth box-shadow animation
- Loops until next flip
- Customizable intensity

#### Confetti Effect (Ready for Implementation)
- CSS animation for celebration confetti
- Can be triggered on big wins
- Colorful falling particles
- Randomizable with JavaScript

### User Controls
- Toggle checkbox: "Enhanced 3D Animation"
- Instant switching between modes
- Preference saved in component state
- No page reload required

### Technical Implementation
```css
/* Example: 3D Flip Animation */
@keyframes flip-3d {
  0%   { transform: rotateY(0deg) rotateX(0deg) scale(1); }
  25%  { transform: rotateY(450deg) rotateX(15deg) scale(1.1); }
  50%  { transform: rotateY(900deg) rotateX(0deg) scale(1.2); }
  75%  { transform: rotateY(1350deg) rotateX(-15deg) scale(1.1); }
  100% { transform: rotateY(1800deg) rotateX(0deg) scale(1); }
}
```

### Performance Considerations
- Hardware-accelerated CSS transforms (rotateY, rotateX, scale)
- No JavaScript animation loops (uses CSS keyframes)
- Efficient particle creation with CSS variables
- GPU-optimized for smooth 60fps animation

```solidity
// Add to CoinFlipBetting.sol
mapping(address => address) public referrers;
mapping(address => uint256) public referralEarnings;

function placeBetWithReferral(
    uint256 _amount, 
    bool _choice, 
    address _referrer
) public {
    // ... existing bet logic ...
    if (_referrer != address(0) && _referrer != msg.sender) {
        uint256 commission = _amount * 5 / 100;
        referralEarnings[_referrer] += commission;
    }
}
```
